                <p>While working as the only designer at one of my former employers (unable to say due to NDA), I was assigned to work with one of the c-suite level, 1 product manager, and 3 senior engineers to redesign and develop the proprietary platform tool for the organization. This new platform tool consists of some notable features such as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Overall client’s health and their forecasting for e-commerce purposes</li>
                    <li>All-in-one full visibility for the managers to organize and delicate projects among their teams</li>
                    <li>Seamless Integration of organic and paid media feeds for a variety of social platforms</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I was tasked with creating a new design system for the internal platform tool. The design system at that time lacked consistency, some sections were outdated, and some components/patterns were left much open to interpretation. Due to privacy reasons, I can’t show the bulk of my work for this project but I’ll provide some insights for the design system approach.

                <p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
                <p>Implement an improved design system from the current one that would streamline design workflows, create the start-to-end deliverables quickly, and make the standardization for reusable components, typography, and color treatment.</p>
                <p><b>Approach</b></p>
                <p>Doing an assessment on the current design system then exploring other existing design systems on the web for references while combining best practice that is suitable for the internal teams.</p>
                <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
                <p>There is a new and improved design system that keep things clean and organized across the company; this will align all teams more structurally and speed up the design process as well as the development process</p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>During the research phase, I sought to understand the trends that set the standard for the music streaming industry. I also needed to uncover the needs and frustrations of the target user to better understand how to appeal to them.</p>
                <p><b>Research Goals</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define people's common behaviors when streaming music.</li>
                    <li>Determine what makes a streaming music experience satisfying.</li>
                    <li>Determine users’ biggest frustrations when streaming music.</li>
                    <li>Understand how users interact with each other on the music streaming services.</li>
                    <li>Define the standard for streaming music services.</li>
                    <li>Understand user needs when streaming music and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Secondary Research: Market Research</b></p>
                <p>First, I conducted secondary research to familiarize myself with Spotify and the music streaming industry overall. In addition to gathering data on user demographics, I researched in depth Spotify’s previous social feature that was discontinued due to low engagement.</p>
                <p><b>Secondary Research: Competitive Analysis</b></p>
                <p>A competitive analysis was performed to understand the strengths, weaknesses, similarities, and differences between competitor music streaming services in the industry.</p>
                <img src="images/image-placeholder2.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset">
                <p>My competitive analysis produced the following insights:</p>
                <p>Findings</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social Features: None of the leading streaming services have a fully fleshed out social feature. It appears to be a function that is not expected by users but is appreciated when it is available.</li>
                    <li>Exclusive Content: This seems to be a major key to attracting users. Platforms aim to show that they can deliver the newest, most unique content before competitors. exclusive access is used in place of social communication to make users feel a sense of community and “in the know.”</li>
                    <li>Personalization: Most personalization on these apps takes form as curated playlists. While some apps give the user a profile page, there is limited functionality or options for it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Secondary Research - Provisional Personas</b></p>
                <p>I created provisional personas that reflected the data I had collected through user research. Getting a sense of the general target audience helped me think about how the business would appeal to different demographics with varying needs.</p>

            <p>Even though it was a successful launch and my time was short in the role, I saw significant positive numbers in the data tracking. Here are some takeaways based on the 3 months analysis using a heatmap and the company’s internal tracking tool:
            </b></p>
            <ul>
                <b><li>15% increase on Average Time on Page</li></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did an A/B testing that included one of the core features. This gave us an indication that users are spending more time on the page due to the relevant data that is structured around the new design system.</li>
                </ul>
                <b><li>45% increase in positive feedback</li></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since it was built for internal teams only, I’ve pushed out a 5-star survey w/ feedback option. We’ve received an overwhelming amount of 4-5 stars feedback.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>Sometimes working on a design system can be overlooked while at the same time, challenging. But after finishing and launching the new design system to all departments, our team felt it was quite rewarding knowing this will push many positive impacts for the company. If time permits, I would do additional usability testings whenever the design system gets a sizable update. There’s always room for improvement and how to make a product better even if it’s just for the internal teams.</p>
