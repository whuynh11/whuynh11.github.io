        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>While working as the only designer at one of my former employers (unable to say due to NDA), I was assigned to work with one of the c-suite level, 1 product manager, and 3 senior engineers to redesign and develop the proprietary platform tool for the organization. This new platform tool consists of some notable features such as:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Client’s health based on the overall satisfaction from the services we provide</li>
                <li>All-in-one full visibility for the managers to organize and delicate projects among their teams</li>
                <li>Seamless Integration of organic and paid media feeds for a variety of social platforms</li>
                <li>Client's paid social forecasting tool</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In tangent, 2 senior engineers, another designer, and I were tasked with creating a new design system for the internal platform tool. The design system at that time lacked consistency, some sections were outdated, and some components/patterns were left much open to interpretation. Due to privacy reasons, I can’t show the bulk of my work for this project but I’ll provide some insights for the design system approach.

            <p>Implement an improved design system from the current one that would streamline design workflows, create the start-to-end deliverables quickly, and make the standardization for reusable components, typography, and color treatment.</p>
            <p><b>Approach</b></p>
            <p>Doing an assessment on the current design system then exploring other existing design systems on the web for references while combining best practice that is suitable for the internal teams.</p>
            <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
            <p>There is a new and improved design system that keep things clean and organized across the company; this will align all teams more structurally and speed up the design process as well as the development process</p>

            <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>The current design system was outdated. As a result, the platform tool, some branding aspect, and the teams who uses the design system lacked a shared foundation around the process, design language, visual guidelines, components and UI libraries. In short, this created inefficiencies among the teams and the inconsistencies within our product.<br><br>So let's start with casting the villian. Everybody loves a good villian. The Joker, Killmonger, etc. When I say a villian in the case of Design Systems, the villian is a well-framed and well-named problem. And for this case, thankfully, the villians that stand in the way which are solve it by Design Systems are fairly well understood or fairly clear. There are different words for this but the villians to me the way I put them are inefficiency, insecurity, and inconsistency.
            </p>
            <p><b>Inefficiency</b></p>
            <p>Inefficiency ultimately about designing the same things again and again. Maybe a button, maybe a dropdown, maybe a snackbar and Designer A designs it once and designer B redesigns it a different way and eventually you just design it a millions and that becomes inefficient. You can think about this at an engineering perspective as well where you have to build the same thing again and again and you're not reusing any codes.<br><br>So an example from one of the Jira tasks that I've found, an engineer has spent a fairly long time building a table cell. Then they spend another week to match up with another table cell CSS properties that was already built. Within the platform tool, there are a ton of table cells whether it is a list of employee profiles with task status or client's forecasting budgets, or even project overview. They're all in the form of a table cell and so, there are many instances of a Jira task just like this. And because we didn't have any reusable code and without a design system of reusable components, it'll take unnecessary amount of time to get it done. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder-3.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Insecurity</b></p>
            <p>When we actually interviewed our designers who used to work on this platform about what was problematic in their workflow and they told us they lacked confidence when they were designing. They didn't know what were the best practices were and if what they were doing was actually already proven to not work and so instead of growing in confidence as they spent time working on variety of projects being a designer. There was always this nagging sense of insecurity as to what is the thing that I should or should not be doing.<br><br>An example of this is a modal. Sometimes a modal has a closed x. Sometimes it has a cancel button. What are designers supposed to do? It becomes very unobvious. Similarly, sometimes the primary action on a modal is to the left and sometimes it is to the right. There's no way to determine what is the right approach to this matter.</p>
            <img src="images/modal-issue-example.png" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Inconsistency</b></p>
            <p>I feel like the hatred of inconsistency runs through any designers. The users are losing confidence in the product because of the interface is increasingly unpredictable. You've got to learn to do the same things in different ways again and again.<br><br>So here's an example I have below for that, these are all of the different things that we've used for onboarding. I find this particularly ironic that you are not only having to learn different UI again and again but you're having to learn to learn different UI again and again.</p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder-3.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p>So know your villians and that's where we really begin. And remember a good villian just like Joker, just like Killmonger, they shows a necessity of a hero. In our case, these villians show the necessity of a design system.</p>

    <div class="container">

            <h1>Research</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Before making actual changes and removing things from the old design system, this is where research comes into play. I've used tools like <a href="https://cssstats.com/" target="_blank">CSS Stats</a> which is to find and analyze a site's CSS properties and stylesheets. Below is a visualization of all of the different styling variations on the site prior to making any changes.</p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder2.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Listing The UI Inventory</b></p>
            <p>The inventory process helped us clearly see all discrepancies and inconsistencies across our site and product. We conducted a full two days audit that ran by 2 designers and 1 engineer. The end goal for this exercise is to identify all inconsistencies in our design assets.</p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder2.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>The In-Between</b></p>
            <p>To ensure the success of this project, it was important to get stakeholders and every one is who directly a part of this project on the same page. We systematically promoted the initiative for the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A company-wide presentation where we shared the project's information, the goals, the current state of pain points, and why we are working on this type of project</li>
                <li>Involving the engineers into the scope of the project as early as possible and on a weekly to bi-weekly based to collect any input and concerns from them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By being proactive communication and being transparent in the early stage of this project, we would be promoting the understanding of the project to everyone and the benefits all internal teams will receive from it.</p>

            <p><b>Forming A Strong Communication</b></p>
            <p>Reviewing work is an important part of any design process. It helps everyone to collectively navigate through with decisions and align on details such as visual designs, component designs, and documentations. For this project, we formed a tight schedule that would meet every week for about an hour to discuss the direction and progress of each other's work. We also set up a Slack Channel for design-systems, where we share our progress updates or concerns and requests for feedback. These practices allow us to gather everyone’s perspective and bridge the gap between design and engineering.</p>
            <p><b>Accountability & Tracking Progress</b></p>
            <p>In order to see everything that is going on and tracking the progress, we created a Jira board that be updated by designers and the engineers. With Jira, it helps us plan, assign, and track accordingly. It also helps move tasks to corresponding status (Open, In Progess, Done, In Review) throughout the process.</p>

            <p>By casting strong villians, it drove urgency and necessity to the design system. Regardless of the project, research is always important. It helps lay a foundation and how we could move forward.<br><br>After completing the new design system for all departments, our team felt it was quite rewarding knowing this will push many positive impacts for the company. Even if it is as simple as a static website or a landing page, it will do wonders. If time permits, I would continue to take design ownership and partner with the engineers to ensure the new design system is efficient, secured, and consisted throughout.</p>
