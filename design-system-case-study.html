        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>While working as the only designer at one of my former employers (unable to say due to NDA), I was assigned to work with one of the c-suite level, 1 product manager, and 3 senior engineers to redesign and develop the proprietary platform tool for the organization. This new platform tool consists of some notable features such as:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Client’s health based on the overall satisfaction from the services we provide</li>
                <li>All-in-one full visibility for the managers to organize and delicate projects among their teams</li>
                <li>Seamless Integration of organic and paid media feeds for a variety of social platforms</li>
                <li>Client's paid social forecasting tool</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In tangent, 2 senior engineers and I were tasked with creating a new design system for the internal platform tool. The design system at that time lacked consistency, some sections were outdated, and some components/patterns were left much open to interpretation. Due to privacy reasons, I can’t show the bulk of my work for this project but I’ll provide some insights for the design system approach.

            <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>The current design system was outdated. As a result, the platform tool, some branding aspects, and the teams who uses the design system lacked a shared foundation around the process, design language, visual guidelines, components, and UI libraries. In short, this created inefficiencies within the product and amongst the teams.<br><br>So let's start with casting the villain. Everybody loves a good villain. The Joker, Killmonger, etc. When I say a villain in the case of Design Systems, the villain is a well-framed and well-named problem. And for this case, thankfully, the villains that stand in the way can be solved by Design Systems and fairly understood and clear. There are different words for this but the villains to me the way I put them are inefficiency, insecurity, and inconsistency.
            </p>
            <p><b>Inefficiency</b></p>
            <p>Inefficiency is ultimately about designing the same things again and again. Maybe a button, a dropdown, a snackbar and Designer A designs it once and Designer B redesigns it a different way. Eventually, the stack of different design styles becomes inefficient. You can think about this from an engineering perspective as well where you have to build the same thing again and again and you're not reusing any codes.<br><br>So an example from one of the Jira tasks that I've found, an engineer has spent a fairly long time building a table cell. Then they spend another week to match up with another table cell CSS properties that were already built. Within the platform tool, there are a ton of table cells whether it is a list of employee profiles with task status or client's forecasting budgets or even project overview. They're all in the form of a table cell and so, there are many instances of a Jira task just like this. And because we didn't have any reusable code and without a design system of reusable components, it'll take an unnecessary amount of time to get it done. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder-3.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Insecurity</b></p>
            <p>When we actually interviewed our designers who used to work on this platform about what was problematic in their workflow and they told us they lacked confidence when they were designing. They didn't know what were the best practices were and if what they were doing was already proven to not work and so instead of growing in confidence as they spent time working on a variety of projects being a designer. There was always this nagging sense of insecurity as to what is the thing that I should or should not be doing.<br><br>An example of this is a modal. Sometimes a modal has a closed x. Sometimes it has a cancel button. What are designers supposed to do? It becomes very unobvious. Similarly, sometimes the primary action on a modal is to the left and sometimes it is to the right. There's no way to determine what is the right approach to this matter.</p>
            <img src="images/modal-issue-example.png" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Inconsistency</b></p>
            <p>I feel like the hatred of inconsistency runs through any designer. The users are losing confidence in the product because the interface is increasingly unpredictable. You've got to learn to do the same things in different ways again and again.<br><br>So here's an example I have below for that, these are all of the different ways that we've used for onboarding. I find this particularly ironic that you are not only having to learn different onboarding process again and again but you're having to learn different UI again and again.</p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder-3.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p>So know your villains to know where to being. Remember, a good villain (like the Joker and Killmonger), shows a necessity of a hero. In our case, these villains show the necessity of a design system.</p>

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h1>Research</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Before making actual changes and removing things from the old design system, this is where research comes into play. I've used tools like <a href="https://cssstats.com/" target="_blank">CSS Stats</a> which is to find and analyze a site's CSS properties and stylesheets. Below is a visualization of all of the different styling variations on the site prior to making any changes.</p>
            <img src="images/css-stats-example-image.png" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>Listing The UI Inventory</b></p>
            <p>The inventory process helped us clearly see all discrepancies and inconsistencies across our site and product. We conducted a full two days audit that ran by 2 designers and 1 engineer. The end goal for this exercise is to identify all inconsistencies in our design assets.</p>
            <img src="images/image-placeholder2.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300">
            <p><b>The In-Between</b></p>
            <p>To ensure the success of this project, it was important to get stakeholders and everyone is who directly a part of this project on the same page. We systematically promoted the initiative for the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A company-wide presentation where we shared the project's information, the goals, the current state of pain points, and why we are working on this type of project</li>
                <li>Involved the engineers in the initial scope of the project and met on a weekly to bi-weekly basis to obtain feedback/progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By being proactive communication and being transparent in the early stage of this project, we would be promoting the understanding of the project to everyone and the benefits all internal teams will receive from it.</p>

            <p><b>Forming A Strong Communication</b></p>
            <p>Reviewing work is an important part of any design process. It helps everyone to collectively navigate through with decisions and align on details such as visual designs, component designs, and documentations. For this project, we formed a tight schedule that would meet every week for about an hour to discuss the direction and progress of each other's work. We also set up a Slack Channel for design-systems, where we share our progress updates or concerns and requests for feedback. These practices allow us to gather everyone’s perspective and bridge the gap between design and engineering.</p>
            <p><b>Accountability & Tracking Progress</b></p>
            <p>In order to have full visibility on the project, a Jira board was created so designers and engineers can update their progress. With Jira, it helps us plan, assign, and track accordingly. It also helps move tasks to corresponding status (Open, In Progress, Done, In Review) throughout the process.</p>

            <p>By casting strong villains, it drove urgency and necessity to the design system. Regardless of the project, research is always important. It helps lay a foundation and how we could move forward.<br><br>After completing the new design system for all departments, our team felt it was quite rewarding knowing this will push many positive impacts for the company. Even if it is as simple as a static website or a landing page, it will do wonders. If time permits, I would continue to take design ownership and partner with the engineers to ensure the new design system is efficient, secured, and consistent throughout.</p>
