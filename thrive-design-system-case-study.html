            <p>One of my former employers</p>
            <p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
            <p>Implement an improved design system from the current one that would streamline design workflows, create the start-to-end deliverables quickly, and make the standardization for reusable components, typography, and color treatment.</p>
            <p><b>Approach</b></p>
            <p>Doing a full scale stragetic approach on the current design system then explored other notable design systems while combining best practices for inclusive design with localization efforts.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>These colors compliment the primary colors and help certain components stand out.</li>

                <b><li>Evaluating Design Tokens</li></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>These colors help convey messages and communicate purposely.</li>

                <ul>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
            <p>There is a new and improved design system that keep things clean and organized across the company; this will align all teams more structurally and speed up the design process as well as the development process.</p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>During the research phase, I sought to understand the trends that set the standard for the music streaming industry. I also needed to uncover the needs and frustrations of the target user to better understand how to appeal to them.</p>
                <p><b>Research Goals</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define people's common behaviors when streaming music.</li>
                    <li>Determine what makes a streaming music experience satisfying.</li>
                    <li>Determine users’ biggest frustrations when streaming music.</li>
                    <li>Understand how users interact with each other on the music streaming services.</li>
                    <li>Define the standard for streaming music services.</li>
                    <li>Understand user needs when streaming music and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Secondary Research: Market Research</b></p>
                <p>First, I conducted secondary research to familiarize myself with Spotify and the music streaming industry overall. In addition to gathering data on user demographics, I researched in depth Spotify’s previous social feature that was discontinued due to low engagement.</p>
                <p><b>Secondary Research: Competitive Analysis</b></p>
                <p>A competitive analysis was performed to understand the strengths, weaknesses, similarities, and differences between competitor music streaming services in the industry.</p>
                <img src="images/image-placeholder2.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset">
                <p>My competitive analysis produced the following insights:</p>
                <p>Findings</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social Features: None of the leading streaming services have a fully fleshed out social feature. It appears to be a function that is not expected by users but is appreciated when it is available.</li>
                    <li>Exclusive Content: This seems to be a major key to attracting users. Platforms aim to show that they can deliver the newest, most unique content before competitors. exclusive access is used in place of social communication to make users feel a sense of community and “in the know.”</li>
                    <li>Personalization: Most personalization on these apps takes form as curated playlists. While some apps give the user a profile page, there is limited functionality or options for it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Secondary Research - Provisional Personas</b></p>
                <p>I created provisional personas that reflected the data I had collected through user research. Getting a sense of the general target audience helped me think about how the business would appeal to different demographics with varying needs.</p>

                <p><b>Point of View Statements & How Might We Questions</b></p>
                <p>After wrapping up primary research, I dug deeper into the insights and needs I had generated. First, I restructured insights into POV statements, an actionable problem statement that defines the design challenge. Next, I restructured those POV statements into How Might We questions that would generate solution-oriented brainstorming.</p>
                <img src="images/image-placeholder-3.jpeg" class="img-responsive image-asset">
                <p><b>Business and User Goals</b></p>
                <p> I reflected on the business goals, user goals, and technical considerations to find a happy medium for all stakeholders. Once I had identified common areas, I could decide what product features were necessary for the prototype.</p>

                <p><b>Wireframes: Low-Fidelity</b></p>
                <p>I began the process of wireframing with sketches of several of the main screens for the Artist Moments social feature. During this process, I thought about how the layout and content could be structured to satisfy user and business goals in a technically feasible way. The sketch I chose served as a guide for my digital wireframes.</p>
                <div id="home">

                <p style="padding-top: 40px;"><b>Wireframes: High-Fidelity</b></p>
                <p>I created a low-fidelity prototype of the social features in Sketch. I created a UI requirements document to outline all of the features and elements I wanted to incorporate into the design.</p>

                <p><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Head to John Legend’s Artist Moment, and leave a comment on the video.</li>
                    <li>View Lady Gaga’s activity in the social feed, and share her music selection to your Instagram Story.</li>
                    <li>In the Social Feed, change the privacy settings of your Britney Spears post to private.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Findings:</p>
                <p>All participants were able to complete all tasks; however there. Navigating to the Artist Moment video and leaving a comment proved to be the most confusing task for users. That task revealed an assumption that I did not realize I had been making: that people would understand the Artist Moments feature based on using similar video features on Instagram and Snapchat.</p>
