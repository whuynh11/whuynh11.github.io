                <p>Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, I can’t show the bulk of my work that I did at TF International, so for now, you’ll just have to trust that I actually did quite a lot during the ~6 months I worked there. I was a UI | UX Product Designer on the Performance Creative team, leading design on the learning platform, primarily focused on performance management and user engagement. Here are some brief notes about the work I did during this time —</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Implemented new continuous feedback model that encourages feedback to be given/requested throughout the year, and not just during official evaluation periods.</li>
                <li>Successfully built solutions that helped employees spend less time writing feedback without reducing quality. Success was measured through data insights and user research.</li>
                <li>Introduced guidance and educational tools throughout the product to promote and encourage Facebook’s feeback culture.</li>
                <li>Built a Messenger bot to help remind employees to request/write feedback throughout the year. Based on this work, we also built a stand-alone feedback bot that could be integrated into Facebook's Workplace offering. It can be installed by any of Workplace’s existing customers to help encourage peer feedback amongst their employees. I designed the branding, bot UX, and the marketing page (and even wrote most of the front-end code for the site). This was a public facing project, so I can show you a quick preview of the site!</li>

                <p>If time permits, I would like to add a screen to show how the Social Feed activity and Artist Moments would display on the Artist profile. Now that the recommendations have been incorporated into the prototype, I am interested in doing additional usability testing to determine whether the feature is more intuitive.  I will use Zeplin to hand off the design to  the developer team when I have made all improvements to the prototype.</p>
