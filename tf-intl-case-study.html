                <p>TF International is a real estate's industry coaching and training company that impact professionals to fulfill their greatness.</p>
                <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, I can’t show the bulk of my work that I did at TF International, so for now, you’ll just have to trust that I actually did quite a lot during the ~6 months I worked there. I was a UI | UX Product Designer on the Performance Creative team, leading design on the learning platform, primarily focused on performance management and user engagement. Here are some brief notes about the work I did during this time —</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented new continuous feedback model that encourages feedback to be given/requested throughout the year, and not just during official evaluation periods.</li>
                    <li>Successfully built solutions that helped coaches spend less time writing feedback without reducing quality. Success was measured through data insights and user research.</li>
                    <li>Introduced guidance and educational tools throughout the application to promote and encourage Tom Ferry’s feeback culture.</li>
                    <li>Designed a Messenger bot to help remind both coaches and real estate agents to request/write feedback throughout the year. Based on this feature alone, we also built a stand-alone feedback bot that could be integrated into other future applications within the same TF ecosystem. I designed the branding, user interface, and the promotion landing page.</li>

                    <li>Designed the first iteration of Messenger bot tool to help employees onboard new coaches and real estate agents based on their dynamic requirements.</li>
                    <li>Crafted a collaborative experience (with the help from the Product & Sales team) that utilized existing data and forecasting data to strategically upsell users into higher plans.</li>

                <p>These features can be tested in beta mode for a select number of accounts; both coaches and real estate agents. New sets of feedback would be gathered to understand how these features are used and what the pain points are for future iterations.</p>

                <p>If time permits, I would like to add Tips & Insight module to the messenger bot. Now that the main feature have been incorporated into the prototype, I am interested in doing additional usability testing to determine whether the feature is more intuitive. I will use Adobe XD to hand off the design to the developer team when I have made all improvements to the prototype.</p>
